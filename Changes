      was posted if the dc:identifier was missing. (Ben Trott)
    - Fixed bug in Data were a "subroutine exited via next" warning
      was generated if the dc:identifier didn't match the permalink
      URI, or if the dc:identifier was empty. (Ben Trott)
    - In Data, if the TrackBack RDF contains invalid (misspelled, even)
      DC elements, Net::Trackback::Data was croaking. Now issue a 
      warning. (Ben Trott)
